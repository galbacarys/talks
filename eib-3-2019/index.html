# Pipes or Spaghetti?
## A look at modern software through old lenses

???

Hi, my name is Gabe Albacarys. This is my first talk at anything resembling a "public" forum
so buckle in, because it's going to be a bit of an adventure.

This talk is entitled "Pipes or Spaghetti?", and in the next 30 minutes or so I'm going to
make fun of all of you, make us all feel bad about our jobs, and do some stupid shit with Bash.
But before I start any of that, "Pipes or spaghetti", why did I choose that name?

Now we've all seen pictures like this: this is one of Google's datacenters in Georgia. Clearly
this is an *incredibly* complex system filled with all sorts of crazy things going on at any given
hour of the day, but it's organized.

Every cable, every wire, every box, every rack is meticulously labeled. The design of each individual
system is complex in its own right, but together they are far greater than the sum of their parts.
All the pipes lead somewhere, and even though there are a lot, we know where they go and why they exist.

Now, this is your system. Notice how it's...slightly...messier than the previous shots, and yet at way
smaller scale! This is the hell most of us work in day in, day out.

Conveniently, these ethernet cables are also the same color as spaghetti, which makes this terrible
analogy work. Unlike the pipes in the previous example, I'd be willing to bet that the guy that originally
built this couldn't point to one of those cables and tell you what it does. Untangling this system and
determining how it works would be a herculean task.

The truth us, we really, really suck at building systems as software engineers, and it shows in our
work. Think back to those datacenters: thousands of racks, each with dozens of machines, all built
from commodity, standards-driven parts, designed to fit together to within thousandths of an inch, are
assembled in an organized, predetermined fashion to build an effective means of housing, running, cooling,
and storing all our shitty work.

(This is where I'm going to start insulting you all)

It doesn't matter how big or small your company is, it doesn't matter how smart you or your staff are...

# YOUR SOFTWARE SUCKS.

???

Your software sucks.

This is a known reality, and is probably the least controversial statement in this entire talk.

It wasn't always this way though, and it doesn't have to be this way. I want to take a trip with y'all down
the cobblestone-paved pathways of computing history and show you some good software.

This is the document that one of my tech idols, Jessie Frazelle (go check her out, she rocks!) referenced in an
article a couple of months ago. It was written by Doug McIlroy, an early (and oft-forgotten) pioneer in the
development of UNIX. He says here,

"We should have some ways of coupling programs like garden hose-screw in another segment when it becomes
necessary to massage data in another way. This is the way of IO also."

This is an incredible insight, and it manifests itself many years later in the advent of the single most important
invention in the creation of the modern computer: the pipe.

Now for those of you that aren't super into shell scripting, let me show you the ABSOLUTE POWER of the pipe.

# cat /var/log/apt/history.log  | grep install | cut -d':' -f 2 | figlet

This command shows us a history of every event that's happened with the package manager on my system.

GREP searches for a word in lines of text, and wouldn't you know it? The output we had before has now been trimmed down
into a set of lines that contain the word "install"!

So obviously the first question here would be, how does this happen? and the answer is pretty simple.
